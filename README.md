=Purpose of System=
Ontario’s aging population is putting a strain on the health care system. Patients who require care in long term care facilities are taking up valuable hospital resources. 
Our system(EOBC) will allow healthcare administrators to see where this is happening and where the need for long term care facilities is greatest. 
EOBC will also help track occupancy rates for types of care offered at different facilities, waiting list sizes for long term care facilities, and reporting capabilities 
for comparison and contrast between facilities and dates.
