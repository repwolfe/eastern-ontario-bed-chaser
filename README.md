EOBC
====
## Origin Details
This C++ with Qt program was written for a University course taken in 2011. The course was Object-Oriented Software Engineering.
Given a project description, we were required to define project requirements, create object definitions, draw sequence diagrams,
and design subsystem decomposition. Once all the design was in place, our team was tasked with programming everything from scratch using Git.

This is the original project, written for Linux. It was originally designed to work with Carleton University's network. Some changes are thus
required to run the program on Windows and on a different style network.

## Purpose of System
Ontario’s aging population is putting a strain on the health care system. Patients who require care in long term care facilities are taking up valuable hospital resources. 
Our system(EOBC) will allow healthcare administrators to see where this is happening and where the need for long term care facilities is greatest. 
EOBC will also help track occupancy rates for types of care offered at different facilities, waiting list sizes for long term care facilities, and reporting capabilities 
for comparison and contrast between facilities and dates.
